Purpose: ingest data from API, push records to NoSQL database, pull those records, transform and visualize data

Requirements: python, airflow, MongoDB

Desired outputs:
    - Emails: success, or error
    - Graph on local web app?
    - Clean, queryable database (maybe also a tabular EDW?)

Rough steps:
    - launch Airflow

    - execute a push py file
        - connect to mongo client
        - parse db dict
            - catch var type errors
            - init any new db/collection
        - request data from API
        - push to MongoDB
            - object checking?
        - close connection

    - execute a pull py file
        - connect to mongo client
        - extract data into pandas
        - transform and visualize based on user dict choices
        - push visualization/table to web app or something
        - email with success or failures (configure in Airflow?)
        - close connection

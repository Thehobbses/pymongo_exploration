Exploring NoSQL with Pymongo and MongoDB, parallelization, and expanding API request experience

As far as I'm aware, this script wont work without a MongoDB Atlas environment set up. 
There is functionality in the MongoDBTools to change a few lines of code and run this on a local Mongo server.
Currently, there are options to push and read collections in your DB. 
I'll add some more fun direct-from-Mongo analysis stuff if I ever need to use NoSQL in a work environment. 
In the meantime, I'm just going to add some simple Pandas transformations and visualizations.
